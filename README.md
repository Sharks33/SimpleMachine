# SimpleMachine

This simple machine was built to demonstrate class hierarchy and
inheritance in OOP (in this case Python).

PROMPT:
Construct a simple machine that when online can be powered on and
off by clicking a button. If the machine is powered off, then the
user will be notified via a pop up alert message and a log file will
be updated with the date and time the machine was shutdown.

SPECIAL REQUIRMENT:
The Function call for pressing the button cannot be modified for future
Implementations such as modifying or creating new classes, thus we will
need to loop through a list of class instances, which will be dynamically
passed in and executed upon each call of the button function.

SETUP:
In order to run this program you will need Python installed on your
machine (version 2 or 3). You will also need to install pip for the alert
message to work properly.
